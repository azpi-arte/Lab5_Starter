1. 
I would not use unit testing on a messaging faeture because unit testing is geared towards testing individual pieces of features. Unit testing is nto efficient at testing interactive features in this case which messaging falls under because there are multiple parts to the messaging feature.

2. 
I would use unit testing to test the max message length because this is a much more discrete and testable piece of code. It doesn't invole testing whether the other person recieved the text or anything interactive like that.
